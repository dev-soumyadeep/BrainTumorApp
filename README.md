# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection and Classification Web App

This is a Flask-based web application that allows users to upload MRI images for brain tumor **detection** and **classification**. The app uses deep learning models to analyze MRI scans and determine whether a tumor is present and, if so, what type of tumor it is.

It also features a hospital locator to find nearby hospitals based on your current location.

## 🚀 Features

- 📤 Upload MRI brain scan images  
- 🔍 Detect presence of a tumor using a binary classifier  
- 🧠 Classify the tumor type: **Glioma**, **Meningioma**, **Pituitary**, or **Others**  
- 📍 Find nearby hospitals using geolocation and Overpass API  
- 💡 Clean, responsive UI built with **Bootstrap**
